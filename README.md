## ❌ What is this?

Tired of LinkedIn trauma? Sick of unsolicited career advice?  
Seeing the word `job` in the wild is a violation.  
So we made **Job Censor** – a browser extension that automatically censors the worst of corporate vocabulary.

Built for those who do **not** dream of labor.

## 🧠 Features

Job Censor uses ✨ advanced ✨ find-and-replace to scramble your browsing experience:

- `job` → `j*b`
- `work` → `w*rk`
- `salary` → `s****y`
- `application` → `applic*tion`
- `hiring`, `resume`, `position`, `career`, etc... → obliterated

Want to add more? You totally can. But also: why are you trying so hard?
