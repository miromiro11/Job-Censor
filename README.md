# 🧠 jobFilter – The Anti-Employment Browser Extension

> Censors the most cursed terms on the internet:  
> **job**, **salary**, **work**, **application** – GONE. Banished. Vaporized.

## ❌ What is this?

Tired of LinkedIn trauma? Sick of career advice? Hate seeing the word `j*b` on your screen?

**jobFilter** is the Chrome/Firefox extension nobody asked for —  
a brainrot-coded defense system that **automatically censors corporate buzzwords** from websites so you can browse in peace 🕊️

---

## 🔒 Protected Terms

By default, this extension will censor the following career threats:
- `job` → `j*b`
- `work` → `w*rk`
- `salary` → `s****y`
- `application` → `applic*tion`
- `career`, `position`, `resume`, `hiring`, `interview`, and more...

Want to add your own? You can. But why are you trying so hard? It’s a joke.

## 🧩 How it works

1. Injects a content script into every page.
2. Finds cursed words.
3. Replaces them with censored, meme-safe versions.
4. Profit (emotionally, not financially obviously).

## 🖼️ What it looks like

Before:  
> “Exciting new **job opportunity** with competitive **salary**!”

After:  
> “Exciting new **j\*b opportunity** with competitive **s\*\*\*y**!”

## 🧠 Made for the Brainrot Generation

jobFilter is part of a movement.  
We do not dream of labor.  
We dream of a feed where `j*b` is the most work we’ll see today.
